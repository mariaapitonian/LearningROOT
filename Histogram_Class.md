Histogram classes in ROOT

Dimensions: TH 1, 2, and 3
1. 1-Dim, 
2. 2-Dim, and 
3. 3-Dim respectively

Type: TH1 C, S, I, F, D 
1. chars (1 byte), (maximum bin content: 255=2^8-1), 
2. shorts (maximum bin content: 2^16-1), 
3. ints (maximum bin content: 2^31-1), 
4. floats (maximum precision: 7 digits), and 
5. doubles (maximum precision: 14 digits) respectively

Therefore, the histogram classes are:
TH1C, TH1S, TH1I, TH1F, TH1D
TH2C, TH2S, TH2I, TH2F, TH2D
TH3C, TH3S, TH3I, TH3F, TH3D
