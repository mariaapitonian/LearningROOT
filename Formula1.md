TF1
- Formula class in ROOT
- Plots 1-Dim function defined between lower and upper limit

Macro file can be edited to edit the plotted function
OR canvas can be opened and edited through view-> editor (this is easier if you don't know color codes etc)
--> the macro of the edited version can also be saved in order to have that design

In the original document, we can also put something like f1->SetLineColor(kBlue+3) before f->Draw() in order to edit specific features from the default.
