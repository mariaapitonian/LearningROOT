TF1
- Formula class in ROOT
- Plots function on a 1-Dim defined between lower and upper limit
- Lower and upper limits for x are given, range for y is automatically determined but can be edited

Macro file can be edited to edit the plotted function
OR canvas can be opened and edited through view-> editor (this is easier if you don't know color codes etc)
--> the macro of the edited version can also be saved in order to have that design

In the original document, we can also put something like f1->SetLineColor(kBlue+3) before f->Draw() in order to edit specific features from the default.


For colors, see wheel.png or go to View->Colors on any canva
